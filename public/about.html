<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi. You can call me a "coding freak". </p>
<p>I am very new to programming. Very fresh. But very determined to achieve great heights.</p>
<p>I love watching movies and learning to code hand-in-hand.</p>
<p>I am a pet lover and I love dogs.</p>
<p>I want to be an entrepreneur and do great things and help needy people.</p>
<p>I believe that we all have the potential to achieve something spectacular. But remember one step at a time.</p>
<p>Love you all. God Bless everyone (including me :-)</p>
